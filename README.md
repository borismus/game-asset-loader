# Manifest format

* assetRoot: contains the root URL under which all of the assets reside
* bundles: an array of objects which describe groups of assets, containing:
    * name: a unique name for the group of assets
    * contents: an array containing relative pathes to each asset in the bundle
* autoDownload: a flag that, if true, will start downloading all of the bundled
  assets in order as soon as GAL inits

Here is an example manifest file:

    {
      "assetRoot": "url/to/assets",
      "bundles": [
        {
          "name": "unique bundle name",
          "contents": [
            "relative/path/to/asset.jpg",
            "another/asset.mp3"
          ]
        },
        ...
      ],
      "autoDownload": true
    }

# Sample Usage

Initializing the loader.

    var gal = new GameAssetLoader("http://path.to/gal.manifest");

    // Load the GAL. If manifest indicates autoDownload, this call will
    // start loading assets one by one.
    gal.init(function() {
      // Called when the library is initialized
    });

Setup callbacks to check bundle loading completion and downloaded
states.

    // Set a callback so that whenever bundleName is ready to use,
    gal.onLoaded("bundleName", function(info) {
      // This function is called
      // Note: if the bundle is loaded already, callback fires right away
      // info.bundleName contains the bundle that was just loaded
    });

    // Set a callback whenever a bundle is being loaded
    gal.onProgress("bundleName", function(progress) {
      // Calls back with progress.current and progress.total whenever more
      // of the bundle is downloaded.
    });

    // Set a callback whenever any bundle loading causes an error
    gal.onError(function(error) {
      // Error contains some stuff
    });

Explicitly download a bundle (this only makes sense if autoDownload is
false)

    // Tell blockName to download
    gal.download("blockName");

Check that a bundle is already loaded. For example, if you"re about to
launch Level 5, you should ensure that Level 5 assets are loaded.

    // Synchronous version of onBundleLoaded
    gal.checkLoaded("bundleName", function(result) {
      // result.loaded iff successfully loaded
    });

Get local URLs to downloaded assets.

    var url = gal.get("image/baz.png");
